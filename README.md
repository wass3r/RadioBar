# RadioBar

Basic macOS menubar app to play SomaFM radio stations with help from [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps), VLC, and Briefcase.

## Why?

Initially just an idea to try `rumps`, but in daily use since. A simple, lite, and unobtrusive way to play internet radio.

No affiliation with SomaFM. They just had an easy station feed and good selection of genres, so you can station-hop depending on mood. Go support them @ https://somafm.com/support/.

## Roadmap

Mostly just regular maintenance to keep it working and maybe small-ish improvements.

The only thing I might explore further as a feature is the ability to pull stations from a local, custom config.
